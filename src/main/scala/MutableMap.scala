/**
 * A mutable store mapping string keys to values of type [[ V ]].
 *
 * @tparam V the type of values to be stored in the mutable map.
 *
 * @equations implementations need to fulfill the following equations:
 *
 * == Storing and Retrieving ==
 *
 * Looking up a previously stored value with the same key should result in
 * the original value (assume `m: MutableMap`, `k: String`, `v: V`):
 * {{{
 *   m.put(k, v); m.get(k)   ==   v
 * }}}
 *
 * Storing a different value for the same key overrides the old one (assume `v2: V`):
 * {{{
 *   m.put(k, v); m.put(k, v2); m.get(k)   ==   v2
 * }}}
 *
 * Looking up the same key without intermediate stores will result in the same value:
 * {{{
 *   m.put(k, v)
 *   val first = m.get(k)
 *   val second = m.get(k)
 *   first   ==   second   ==   v
 * }}}
 *
 * Looking up a key that has not been stored before results in an [[EntryNotFoundException]].
 * {{{
 *   m.get(k)   ==   throw EntryNotFoundException(k)
 * }}}
 *
 *
 * == Checking Presence ==
 * Asking whether a key that we never previously stored is defined, results in false:
 * {{{
 *   m.contains(k)   ==   false
 * }}}
 *
 * Asking whether a stored key is defined after storing it, results in true:
 * {{{
 *   m.put(k, v); m.contains(k)   ==   true
 * }}}
 *
 * Looking up a key that is not defined results in an [[EntryNotFoundException]].
 * {{{
 *   if !m.contains(k) then m.get(k)   ==   throw EntryNotFoundException(k)
 * }}}
 *
 * Looking up a key that is defined will return some value.
 * {{{
 *   if m.contains(k) then m.get(k)   ==    v   (for some value v)
 * }}}
